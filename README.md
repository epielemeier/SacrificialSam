## Description
Sacrificial Sam is here to save the day, no matter the costs! Are you ready to be a hero? Innocent bystanders are scattered throughout a city overrun by machines, and it is up to you to help them get out alive.

A Metroidvania put on its head, Sacrificial Sam takes away the world and mechanics as you progress. It was created using Godot in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 43 compo (Theme: Sacrifices Must Be Made). Art created by me.

Thanks to Tomas Pettersson for the awesome tool sfxr, which generated the game's sound effects.
